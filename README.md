# Musicinator
(Pronouced Musikinator). 

A 5 person project done for the class 'Formal Languages and Automata.' The objective was the creation of both a new programming language, and a compiler from it into another Turing-complete language, using Java and ANTLR4.

We created a musical language, and a compiler from it to Python 3, generating a Python file that, when executed, creates a MIDI file with the music. While the code is in English, the documentation for the language itself (in the folder 'Language/') is unfortunately in Portuguese. The last section of the file, however, contains examples, and should be easy to understand.
